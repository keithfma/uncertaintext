# Uncertaintext: an experiment in representing uncertainty

This project explores a silly idea: what if we showed uncertain numbers in
documents not as a constant statistic, but as a shifting sample from the
underlying distribution?

As a first step, I am using a comfortable language (Python) to explore the
basic idea. If this looks promising, I may try to code it up as a javascript
library that could be used in the wild.
