  <h1>Uncertaintext Mark II</h1>

  Example text modified from <a href=https://www2.southeastern.edu/Academics/Faculty/rallain/plab194/error.html>here</a>

  Try determining the thickness of a CD case from this picture.

  <ul>
    <li>How can you get the most precise measurement of the thickness of a single CD case from this picture? (Even though the ruler is blurry, you can determine the thickness of a single case to within less than 0.1 cm.)</li>
    <li>Use the method you just described to determine the thickness of a single case (and the uncertainty in that measurement)</li>
    <li>What implicit assumption(s) are you making about the CD cases?<li>
  </ul>

  Answers: The best way to do the measurement is to measure the thickness of
  the stack and divide by the number of cases in the stack. That way, the
  uncertainty in the measurement is spread out over all 36 CD cases. It's hard to
  read the ruler in the picture any closer than within about 0.2 cm (see previous
  example). The stack goes starts at about the 16.5 cm mark and ends at about the
  54.5 cm mark, so the stack is about 
  <span class=uncertaintext data-mu=38 data-fmt-mu="2.0f" data-sigma=0.2 data-fmt-sigma=".2f" data-fmt-sample="2.2f"></span> cm
  long. Divide the length of the stack by the number of CD cases in the stack
  (36) to get the thickness of a single case:
  <span class=uncertaintext data-mu=1.056 data-fmt-mu="1.3f" data-sigma=0.006 data-fmt-sigma='.3f' data-fmt-sample="1.3f" data-fps=1></span> cm.
  By "spreading out" the uncertainty over the entire stack of cases, you can get
  a measurement that is more precise than what can be determined by measuring
  just one of the cases with the same ruler. We are assuming that all the cases
  are the same thickness and that there is no space between any of the cases.
