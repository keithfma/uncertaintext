# Next Steps

A place to consider my next moves, and make sure all the TODOs get TODONE.


## Publishing 

* Not sure how to publish the packaged module on a CDN (maybe npm is enough)?

## Clean up

* Run prettier and/or eslint to get this shit ship shape

## Write up 

Consider how to write this up -- maybe even a "Try It Out" box?
