# Next Steps

A place to consider my next moves, and make sure all the TODOs get TODONE.


* Run prettier and/or eslint to get this shit ship shape
* Make a better example page, just showing off a few options, etc.
* Figure out how to serve the example without fucking Python, include that in the README.md
