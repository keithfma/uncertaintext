# Next Steps

A place to consider my next moves, and make sure all the TODOs get TODONE.

* Run prettier and/or eslint to get this shit ship shape, and add a required
  status check to make sure it stays that way.
* Add action to build, test the build, and check that the example page
  build is up-to-date
* Add action to automatically build and create a release upon merging to main
